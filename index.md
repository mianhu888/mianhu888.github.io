  I am working as a postdoc researcher with <a href="https://sli.bnu.edu.cn/en/About_us/Leaders/2017/0317/276.html">Prof. Ronghuai Huang</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://cit.bnu.edu.cn/english/index.html">National Engineering Laboratory for Cyberlearning and Intelligent Technology</a> and <a href="https://sli.bnu.edu.cn/en/">Smart Learning Institute</a>, Faculty of Education, <a href="https://fe-english.bnu.edu.cn/index.shtml">Beijing Normal University</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I have earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.cis.udel.edu/"> University of Delaware</a> advised by <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~pollock/"> Dr. Lori Pollock</a>. I am interested in Computing Education, specifically in broaden participation, integration of computational thinking (CT) and subjects in K-12, learning science, co-design with teachers, and data-driven learning behavior analysis.
</p>

<p>
  I am engaging in <a href="https://codebeats.weebly.com/">Code Beats</a>, an NSF-funded project that aims to develop strong CS learning experiences for K-12 students underrepresented in computing through culturally relevant music. In this project, I work closely with <a href="https://education.illinois.edu/about/leadership/dean-chrystalla-mouza"> Dr. Chrystalla Mouza</a> and <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/eng/cse/people/faculty/shepherd.php"> Dr. David Shepherd</a> to analyze multi-dimensional data, including coding artifacts, screen capture videos, survey, and coding process log data in music coding to reveal learning behaviors in CT and understand how to scaffold better learning in music coding.
</p>

<p>
  I also engaged in <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/partner4cs/">Partner4CS</a>, an NSF-funded project toward strengthening CS education within diverse Delaware K-12 populations. I developed a block-based game called <em>Fox and Fileds</em> to conduct a study to ask what types of scaffolds narrow the CT performance gap between experts and novices within a coding obstacle course.

<p>
  I earned my two Master's Degrees in Computer Science and Management, which provided me with the passion and knowledge to connect humans and computing, and further supported me with different thinking perspectives in the Computing Education area.
