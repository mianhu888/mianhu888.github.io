<p>
  I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science supervised by <a gref="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~pollock/"> Dr.Lori Pollock</a> at University of Delaware. I am interested in Computing Education, specifically data-driven learning behaviors.
</p>

<p>
  I work with <a gref="https://codebeats.weebly.com/">CodeBeats</a>, an NSF-funded project aim to develop strong CS learning experiences for K-12 students underrepresented in computing through culturally relevant music. In this work, I analyze learning behviors in music coding by logged coding process data, trying to understand how to better scaffold learning in music coding.

<p>
  I earned my Master's Degree in Management, which provide me passion and knowledge to connect human and computing, and further support me with different thinking perspectives in Computing Education area.
