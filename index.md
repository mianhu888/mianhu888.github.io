  I have earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.cis.udel.edu/"> University of Delaware</a> advised by <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~pollock/"> Dr. Lori Pollock</a>. I am interested in Computing Education, specifically in boarden participation, integration of computational thinking (CT) and subjects in K-12, co-design with teachers, and data-driven learning behavior analysis. I will join  <a href="https://www.henu.edu.cn/"> Henan University</a> in China as an assisstant professor shortly.

<p>
  I am engaging in <a href="https://codebeats.weebly.com/">Code Beats</a>, an NSF-funded project aim to develop strong CS learning experiences for K-12 students underrepresented in computing through culturally relevant music. In this project, I work closely with <a href="https://education.illinois.edu/about/leadership/dean-chrystalla-mouza"> Dr. Chrystalla Mouza</a> to analyze multi-dimensional data, including coding artifacts, screen capture videos, survey, and coding process log data in music coding to reveal learning behviors in CT and understand how to better scaffold learning in music coding.

<p>
  I also engaged in <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/partner4cs/">Partner4CS</a>, a NSF-funded project toward strengthening CS education within diverse Delaware K-12 populations. I developed a block-based game called <em>Fox and Fileds</em> to conduct a study to ask what types of scaffolds narrow the CT performance gap between experts and novices within a coding obstacle course.

  I earned my two Master's Degrees in both Compter Science and Management, which provide me passion and knowledge to connect human and computing, and further support me with different thinking perspectives in Computing Education area.
