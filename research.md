    description: Making music could be a way to learn programming. We teach computational thinking via a curriculum where (1) students learn how to code to manipulate and create hip hop beats and (2) students experience computation. As students make beats, they, almost without noticing, learn fundamental concepts and skills of computer science.

    description: What types of scaffolds narrow the computational thinking (CT) performance gap between experts and novices within a coding obstacle course? We designed Fox and Field, a block-based programming game with different scaffolds and prompted to undergrad students in CS major and non-CS major. We assessed their CT knowledge and logged their programming process data to understand this question.
